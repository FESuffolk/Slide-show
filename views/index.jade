  h2 Why Selectors?
  p CSS is often a great bugbear for those that deal with it regularly, and a great source of confusion for those who are new to the subject. I'm of the opinion that many of the problems to do with CSS come from the way in which people approach it. Having had a wander about the internet and done plenty of view sourcing in my time I've found that a lot of people don't try very hard when it comes to laying out their CSS, I suspect these same people get very frustrated when that element they are trying to style just won't do as they are told and end up resorting to inserting additional ids, classes or even the dreaded !important. I know about this because I do it myself. Because life is short and work is shorter. This presentation is an attempt to save everyone a bit of bother and to avoid resorting to 
    strong desperate measures
