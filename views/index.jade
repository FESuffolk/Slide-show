  blockquote
    strong body
    {font-family:sans-serif;}
  blockquote
    strong #special.selection
    {background-color:teal;}

section
  h2 How Strong is your Selector?
  p Specificity
  p Ids = strong
  p Classes = medium
  p tags = weak
  p chain selectors for more specificity

section
  h2 Cascading
  p order matters
  p cascading
  p strength increases as you travel down

section
  h2 CSS3/HTML5
  p section+p = all &lt;p&gt;s immediately after &lt;section&gt;
  p section~p = all &lt;p&gt;s after &lt;section&gt;
  p section>p = all &lt;p&gt;s that are children of &lt;section&gt;
  p p:first-child = first &lt;p&gt; within it's parent
  p p:nth-child(even) = every other &lt;p&gt; starting with the second element.
  p p:first-of-type = the first &lt;p&gt; on the page
  p p:first-letter = selects the first letter within all &lt;p&gt;s
  p p:before/p:after = create pseudo elements within your &lt;p&gt;s
  p p[data-awesome'='true'] = selects each &lt;p&gt; with the attribute 'data-awesome' set to true
  p media queries = not really selectors but target specific browsers/devices/orientations

section
  h2 SASS/SCSS
  p precompiled stylesheets.
  p nesting more natural layout within the sheet.
  p mixins/variables: store and repeat data throught your sheet.
  p inherits: share styles between selectors more sensibly.

section
  h2 How I do it!
  p Personal preference but worth thinking about
  p All classes lowercase with hyphen between, clear distinction from javascript variables.
  p Order tags > class > ids >media queries
  p Indentation, be obsessive.
  p Avoid ids

section
  h2 Readability
  p CSS is often re-read recycled and re-used.
  p Use whitespace.
  p Semantic naming not style naming.

section
  h2 Conclusion
  p A little work now less work later.
  p Give CSS some time and care it affects how the end user sees your work.
